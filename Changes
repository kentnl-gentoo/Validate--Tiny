Revision history for Validate-Tiny

1.501   2015-04-18 !!! Not backwards compatible. Read notes !!!
        
        [Bug fixes]
        - filters checked for undefined values

        [New features]
        - A new %FILTER hash allows a user to add custom filters
        - Object interface changed - new is now just a constructor and
          check is used to do actual validation. To adapt your code,
          it should be enough to just replace all Validate::Tiny->new with
          Validate::Tiny->check.
        - Removed error_string function
